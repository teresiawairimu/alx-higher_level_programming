### 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

0. Implement a function to display all the integers within a given list.
1. Develop a function that retrieves an element from a list, mimicking the behavior in C.
2. Craft a function that swaps out an element in a list at a specified position, similar to C's approach.
3. Devise a function to print the integers of a list in reverse order.
4. Design a function to replace an element in a list at a specific position without altering the original list, akin to C.
5. Construct a function that eliminates all occurrences of characters 'c' and 'C' from a given string.
6. Create a function for printing a matrix of integers.
7. Formulate a function to add two tuples.
8. Develop a function that returns a tuple containing the length of a string and its initial character.
9. Engineer a function to identify the largest integer in a list.
10. Design a function to identify and return all multiples of 2 within a list.
11. Establish a function to delete an item at a specified position in a list.
12. Finalize the source code to exchange the values of variables 'a' and 'b.'
