0. The program will assign a random signed number to the variable "number" every time it is executed.
1. Develop a program that assigns a random signed number to the variable "number" on each execution.
2. Construct a program to display the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, without a subsequent new line.
3. Integrate a program to showcase the ASCII alphabet in lowercase without a newline character.
4. Enhance the program by adding functionality to print all numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal formats.
5. Devise a program to output numbers ranging from 0 to 99.
6. Build a program that generates and displays all distinct combinations of two digits.
7. Expand the program by incorporating a function that verifies the presence of a lowercase character.
8. Establish a function capable of checking for the existence of a lowercase character.
9. Develop a function that prints the last digit of a given number.
10. Create a function to add two integers and return the resulting sum.
